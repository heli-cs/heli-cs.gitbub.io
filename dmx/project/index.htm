            <h1>Toward Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Computing in Big Data Era</h1>

            <div class="primary">

                <p class="intro">Big data, because it can mine new knowledge for economic growth and technical innovation, has recently received considerable attention, and many research efforts have been directed to big data processing due to its high volume, velocity, and variety (referred to as “3V”) challenges. However, in addition to the 3V challenges, the flourishing of big data also hinges on fully understanding and managing newly arising security and privacy challenges. If data are not authentic, new mined knowledge will be unconvincing; while if privacy is not well addressed, people may be reluctant to share their data. Because security has been investigated as a new dimension, “veracity,” in big data, in this article, we aim to exploit new challenges of big data in terms of privacy, and devote our attention toward efficient and privacy-preserving computing in the big data era. Specifically, we first formalize the general architecture of big data analytics, identify the corresponding privacy requirements, and introduce an efficient and privacy-preserving cosine similarity computing protocol  (privacy preserving scalar product computation)  as an example in response to data mining’s efficiency and privacy requirements in the big data era. <strong>(Rongxing Lu, H. Zhu, X. Liu, J. Liu, and J. Shao, "Towards Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Computing in Big Data Era ", IEEE Network Magazine, Vol. 28, No. 4, pp.46-50, 2014.)</strong>

            <h1>A Novel Privacy-Preserving Set Aggregation Scheme for Smart Grid Communications</h1>

            <div class="primary">

                <p class="intro">In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving set aggregation scheme for smart grid communications. The proposed scheme is characterized by employing a group G of composite order n = pq to achieve two-subset aggregation from a single aggregated data. With the proposed set aggregation scheme, the control center in smart grid is able to obtain more fine-grained data aggregation results for better monitoring and controlling smart grid. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can achieve privacy-preserving with formal proof under random oracle model. In addition, extensive experiments are conducted, the results demonstrate the proposed scheme is also efficient in terms of low computational costs and communication overheads.

            <h1>PGuide:An Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Smartphone-Based Pre-Clinical Guidance Scheme</h1>

            <div class="primary">

                <p class="intro">With the pervasiveness of smartphones, mobile e-Healthcare has attracted considerable attention in recent years. Disease risk prediction, as it can assist in predicting user's disease with big data analytics techniques,  has become one of important topics in the field of e-Healthcare. However, if the privacy issue is not well addressed, disease risk predication cannot step into its flourish. Aiming at addressing this challenge, in this paper, we propose a new efficient and privacy-preserving pre-clinical guidance scheme, called PGuide, which offers self-diagnosis service to medical users in a privacy-preserving way. In specific, to  motivate medical users to provide more detailed health profile for accurate disease risk prediction, we introduce a privacy-preserving   comparison protocol PPCP in the PGuide scheme. As a result, with enough health profile information offered by the medical users, the accuracy of disease risk  prediction can be improved. Detailed security analysis shows that our proposed PGuide scheme ensures the privacy-preservation for both medical users and service provider. In addition, the performance evaluation via extensive experiments also demonstrates that our proposed PPCP protocol is much  efficient in terms of low computational cost and communication overhead.
